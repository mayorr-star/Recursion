# Recursion
This is a simple project that leverages recursion to tackle classic problems: Fibonacci sequence and Merge Sort Algorithm

## Fibonacci Sequence
The Fibonacci Sequence, is a numerical sequence where each number is the sum of the two numbers before it. Eg. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 are the first eight digits in the sequence.

## Merge Sort Algorithm
A significant part of computer science is dedicated to sorting data. An algorithm which uses the ‘divide and conquer’ approach of recursion is able to reduce a sorting problem to smaller and smaller sub-problems.

Merge sort is one such sorting algorithm, and can be much faster than other algorithms such as bubble sort on the right data sets. Essentially merge sort recurses through an array of unsorted data until it reaches its smallest sub-set, a single item. Of course an array with a single item is considered sorted. Merge sort then merges the single items back together in sorted order.
